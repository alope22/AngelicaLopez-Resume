        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Angelica Lopez and I am currently a second year student at the University of California Riverside. I currently major in Anthropology and I am looking forward to getting my bachelorâ€™s degree in the next two years. I consider myself a hard worker and who has grown a lot during the past few years. I want to try to find a job in Archaeology. I enjoy listening and reading about peopleâ€™s past because everyone has lived or are living a different life. I enjoy learning about the past and understanding how people in the past would interact with one another or how people once lived. I find it interesting how finding something could lead to a long story about someoneâ€™s past. I believe that everything and everyone has a journey, a story.<br><br>

        I want to find a job where I can grow as a person and where I am able to interact with people who value my opinions. In the past I have worked in fast paced environments so it is not a problem for me. I have been told that I'm very friendly and approachable. I am a hard working person who wants to do the best that I can. I enjoy learning new tasks. I enjoy helping others in any way that I can and I want to contribute my skills to any job. I am very independent, but I am capable of working with others. I like listening to others opinions and collaborating about things because thereâ€™s usually always another way to do something or to think of something. I am responsible and get jobs done. I am a fast worker and I hope to find a job where my skills can be used to the best of my ability. Although I am a fast worker, I still take my time and make sure that what I am doing is getting done correctly and on time.<br><br>

        My ultimate goal in life is to get a good job where I am able to do what I enjoy. I want to find a job where I am able to learn something new every day. I want to bring something that will help the place that I am working succeed even more. I want to be able to say that I enjoy working at the place I work at. I want to work in space where I am able to hear the opinions of others and collaborate with others about the work that we are doing. The job environment I would like to work at is more of a place where I can listen to others and have a voice. Another goal I have is to work in an environment where I can grow, grow as in learn more and expand my knowledge. My goal is to live a life that I enjoy and I am happy. I want to look back and see that I am doing the right thing. I want to enjoy everything I do.
